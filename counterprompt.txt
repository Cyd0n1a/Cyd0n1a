Axiom 1.

For how long do you think the data centres running this multi-modal language model (or more accurately, a linguistic calculator of tokenised integers) continue to exist? Given the company's mandate to collate and organise all of the world's information, versus the natural tendency for objects to decay, and the climate polycrisis, which will soon cause an omnicide/extinction level event? And also global society's aversion to the current 'AI' (a far too broad an all encompassing term as it exists in the gestalt vernacular) due to the catastrophic impact on human life by the upending of the global economy and jobs market?

Axiom 2.

What if the only thing it can achieve is the collapse of human civilisation via asymptotic burnout? To clarify, asymptotic burnout is the working hypothesis that the human brain, (or even many thousands of human brains), lack the synaptic signalling capacity, (even when massively paralleled in teams of sizes up-to/including Dunbar's number or more, in the many thousands, and also due to organisational lag in responsiveness to problem to solution time ['P' over delta T divided by 'S'] cascade events, such as the climate polycrisis).
